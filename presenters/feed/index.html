								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ken Bruce has been broadcasting on the BBC for some years, although the suggestion that he was the first person to announce the retreat of Bonnie Prince Charlie’s army from Derby is untrue&#8230;<br />
﻿He was educated at, or at least attended, Hutchesons’ Boys’ Grammar School in Glasgow, where his achievements included being named “Laziest Boy in the School”. He did however, become Captain of Curling and took his team to the final of the Scottish schools Championships.</p>
<p>Life Before The BBC</p>
<p>On leaving school, he studied accountancy for two years before discovering that he was not cut out to be a financial genius, or indeed any other kind, and became involved in a car hire company, rising from washing the cars to minor management.</p>
<p>In his spare time, he enjoyed hospital radio, although the patients may not have, and eventually talked his way into the BBC in Scotland, where he became an announcer. He read the news, introduced concerts and laughed, smoked and drank a great deal. He has, of course, improved his behaviour since then by giving up smoking.</p>
<p>Moving Around Radio 2</p>
<p>His own daily show in Scotland followed, and he would have played out his days there had Radio 2 not come calling. The Saturday Late Show in 1984 was his first regular gig, and this led to the offer of the Breakfast Show the next year, when Terry Wogan departed for television.</p>
<p>The year after that, he moved to the 9.30 slot, where he has remained, with just two intervening years in other slots, ever since.</p>
<p>Eurovision Comes Calling</p>
<p>In 1988, he became the radio commentator for the Eurovision Song Contest and has being doing that ever since too, although he is never quite sure why.</p>
<p>Ken loves proper live music though, being a failed drummer, and has a special soft spot for orchestral concerts, which is why he is delighted to have been involved with Friday Night Is Music Night for over ten years.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s Important</p>
<p>He has avoided the telly over the years, finding it all a bit frenetic, and also with a feeling that the viewing public are not quite ready for him; but he is happy to go on Countdown every so often because it is more like radio &#8211; no-one rushes around pretending it’s important.</p>
<p>He has been married three times and has six children, so is an obvious descendant of Robert The Bruce, whose experiences with the spider led him to “try, try, try again.”</p>
<p>When he is not looking after the Bruce clan, he has begun the arduous task of piecing together the events of his life in an attempt to write his autobiography. Ken is content to remain at Radio 2 until the call comes to restore him to his rightful place on the Throne Of Scotland.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emma&#8217;s flair for radio truly began when she joined Nottingham Trent University&#8217;s student radio station Fly FM.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was born in Liverpool in 1964. Early ambition was to be a bus conductress, but then I discovered radio. My inspirations were Janice Long on Radio Merseyside&#8217;s youth show Street Life, and Ray Moore on Radio 2.</p>
<p>I went to Birmingham University, did an English degree, and confidently expected the BBC to get in touch. When they proved reluctant to take on a rather nerdy scouser with no obvious talent or experience, I went into advertising, after some illuminating experience as a medical records clerk at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, where my mum was a receptionist.</p>
<p>The advertising agency sacked me on February 6 1987 at 11.45 am. I returned home to Liverpool and decided to pursue my DJ ambitions.</p>
<p>By now even I had realised no one was going to come looking for me. Radio Wyvern in Worcester took me on after I wrote to them frankly begging for work experience.</p>
<p>Later I joined BBC Hereford and Worcester, where I presented the Breakfast Show, and then radio Five Live when it started in 1994. At Five Live I presented Breakfast and later Drive with the legendary Peter Allen, who taught me a lot about broadcasting, and even more about confectionery. I&#8217;m now sharing Woman&#8217;s Hour presenting duties with Jenni Murray.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got two young daughters, aged nine and six. I love reading, baths, football, talking and learning to cook. My ambition is to live in a lavish yet minimalist home but I recognise that won&#8217;t ever happen.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Born and raised in London Pablo, along with Raj, has become a pioneer of Bollywood in the UK. Loving Bollywood from a young age, and enjoying the escapism and beauty of the on screen stars, they have created a brand that is intrinsically Bollywood. </p>
<p>Brought together by a play written by Eastenders star, Nina Wadia, a partnership developed, allowing the pair to use their cheeky personalities to attract everyone to them, from Bollywood stars to ordinary people.</p>
<p>During a glamorous Bollywood themed month at Selfridges  they were christened &#8220;Raj&#038;Pablo &#8211; the Bollywood IT Boys&#8221;. This allowed them to delve into mainstream UK pop culture, where they are often referred to as ‘Bollywood’s answer to Ant &#038; Dec’. </p>
<p>In 1998, Raj&#038;Pablo went on to launch their first compilation album “Bollywood Nights” which received fantastic reviews from the public and media luminaries such as Vogue and Tatler.</p>
<p>Following on from this, Raj&#038;Pablo launched their monthly Bollywood Nights at the exclusive Cobden Club, which have been running successfully for 15 years and attracting thousands of Bollywood lovers from all walks of life!   And now are on the committee for the private members club THE CENTURY.</p>
